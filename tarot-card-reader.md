Name of Project: Tarot Card Reader

Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)
A tarot card reader for everyone. Users will be able to read the meaning of all the cards that were being selected.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

* The back of 78 tarot cards is listed on the webpage.
* Users will be able to flip the cards with a single click.
* Users will be redirected to the details page when they double-click the cards and read the full meaning of the cards.
* When users click it, it will redirect them to a page with six random cards. Six cards indicate:
1. How you feel about yourself now
2. What you most want at this moment
3. Your fears
4. What is going for you
5. What is going against you
6. The outcome according to your current situation or the question you asked
* On the random page, users should be able to input their name, and what they’re wishing for.
* The random page should be able to shuffle the cards with their spread position or reversal position.
* On the random page, there should be a “Random” button to randomize another six cards.
